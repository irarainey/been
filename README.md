# Been

A simple tool to use AI to create summaries of place you have been from photographs taken at those locations.

To run the tool you need to specify the path to the folder containing the images you want to summarise. The tool will then create a summary of the journey using the images in the folder.

```bash
python src/main.py /workspaces/been/images
```
